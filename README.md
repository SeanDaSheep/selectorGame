# selectorGame
first project using spwn, makes a geometry dash level where you select the correct option to pass.
After running the spwn file, be sure to set the move trigger moving the objects that hold the icon in place
to a duration of 5 seconds. If you want to shorten the level, move all the triggers after to the front as it
does not matter where the triggers are at the back. DO NOT DELETE THEM as this would make the level malfunction.
